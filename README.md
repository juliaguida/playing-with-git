## Git workflow

So, let's sum up the steps we've done so far: #( Work in progress still require and add a few mardown for this readme)

Created a folder for a new project
Initialised a repository inside it
Created some files
Added them to the staging area
Committed them
Created a repo on GitHub
Created a remote called "origin" pointing to GitHub
Pushed the code to the origin.

Whenever you are starting work on a new project, follow these steps. Create a new repository (actually, it doesn't matter where you create it first, you can try creating it first on GitHub and then locally). Create a remote pointing to GitHub. Commit a few changes, regularly push them to GitHub.
You need to be in the directory where the repository is in order to push your data to GitHub. When you do git push or a similar command, git applies it to the directory you are in, so if you're in a wrong directory you won't get the results you expect.
